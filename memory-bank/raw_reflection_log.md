TaskRef: "Initialize Turborepo and Scaffold MCP Server"

Learnings:
- Successfully set up Turborepo for a monorepo with applications and packages.
- Implemented TypeScript Project References for efficient dependency management and compilation across monorepo projects.
- Integrated a refactored MCP core runtime (`@modelcontextprotocol/runtime`) and scaffolded a new generic MCP server.
- Gained experience using `Hono.js` for web frameworks and Zod for schema validation within MCP servers.
- Utilized `pnpm` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for robust dependency management in the monorepo.

Difficulties:
- Encountered persistent TypeScript compilation errors related to module resolution, `composite` flag usage, and incorrect type definitions for MCP interfaces. These were resolved by careful configuration of `tsconfig.json` files across the monorepo.
- Faced issues with `tsup` bundler configuration, which were debugged and corrected to ensure proper module bundling.
- Experienced `npm install` failures due to monorepo structure, successfully mitigated by switching to `pnpm install` and correctly defining workspaces in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Required extensive refactoring of all MCP server modules to adopt the new `MCPService` class-based architecture, ensuring correct import paths, constructor signatures, and proper tool/resource registration.
- Had to manually correct `package.json` dependencies across multiple `mcp-servers` packages to correctly use `workspace:*` for internal monorepo packages.
- Ensured Turborepo correctly executes build tasks by creating `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and clearing the Turborepo cache after changes.

Successes:
- Successfully initialized Turborepo and established a validated monorepo directory structure.
- Successfully scaffolded and integrated a generic MCP server into the monorepo, extending the new `MCPService` class.
- All critical TypeScript compilation and dependency resolution issues were identified and resolved, leading to a stable build environment.
- All MCP servers were successfully refactored to align with the new `MCPService` architecture, ensuring modularity and adherence to the MCP.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: Best practices for TypeScript configuration in Turborepo monorepos (composite projects, path mapping).
- General pattern: Troubleshooting `pnpm` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for monorepo dependency management.
- General pattern: Migrating existing codebases to a new service architecture (e.g., `MCPService` pattern).
- Project-specific: Correct `workspace:*` dependency usage in `package.json` for internal packages.
