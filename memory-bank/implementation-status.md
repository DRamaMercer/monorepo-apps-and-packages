## Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complexity of AI Orchestration | High | Medium | Break into smaller components, implement iteratively |
| Cross-brand context leakage | High | Medium | Implement strict validation and testing of context boundaries |
| Performance of vector search | Medium | High | Early prototyping and performance testing |
| Documentation compliance | Medium | Medium | Automated validation and early stakeholder review |
| Integration challenges | Medium | High | Clear interface definitions, frequent integration testing |

## Conclusion

The implementation is in its early stages, with most focus currently on the documentation and compliance frameworks. The foundation phase is underway with one completed task (monorepo structure) and ongoing work on the traceability system. Next steps will focus on building the core infrastructure components that will enable the more complex AI and brand management features.
