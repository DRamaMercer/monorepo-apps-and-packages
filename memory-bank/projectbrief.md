# Project Brief: Multi-Brand AI Content Studio

## Objective

Build a unified, AI-driven platform for managing, automating, and analyzing multiple brand content operations from a single dashboard. This “multi-brand AI studio” should enable rapid onboarding of new brands, leverage autonomous AI agents to handle content creation and workflows, and provide centralized oversight for analytics and strategy. The solution must maintain each brand’s unique identity and voice while achieving efficiencies through shared infrastructure and intelligent automation.

## Target Users

- **Marketing Teams:** Overseeing content and campaigns across several brands, they need to coordinate strategies and reuse successful tactics without duplicating effort.
    
- **Content Creators/Editors:** Individuals who produce blog posts, social media content, etc., for different brands. The system should help them generate and schedule content (with AI assistance) and enforce brand-specific guidelines.
    
- **Brand Managers & Executives:** Stakeholders who want high-level insights into each brand’s performance and the ability to drill down into specifics, all in one place. They benefit from cross-brand analytics and the ability to quickly spin up new brand initiatives.
    
- **Developers/Technical Ops:** Those responsible for maintaining the platform or integrating new features. The system’s design (autonomous agents, open-source stack) should minimize their manual work (the AI handles routine tasks), allowing them to focus on improvements and new capabilities.
    

## Key Features

- **Centralized Admin Dashboard:** A single web application to manage all brands. Users can switch between SaithavyS, Partly Office, G Prismo (and others) with one click, updating the view to that brand’s content, workflows, and analytics. Common functions like user management and global settings are unified, reducing duplication.
    
- **Brand-Specific Hubs:** Each brand has its own space within the platform (and optionally its own public-facing site). These hubs include content libraries, social media calendars, and brand settings. They are templatized to allow quick setup of a new brand hub with default pages and configurations.
    
- **AI-Assisted Content Creation:** Integrated AI agents that generate content drafts tailored to each brand’s voice. Users can input a prompt or request (e.g., “Draft a blog post about remote work tips”), and the system produces a draft adhering to the brand’s style guide. The content agent also suggests improvements or variations, speeding up the content pipeline dramatically.
    
- **Simple Content Management:** Non-technical editors can create and edit content through a user-friendly interface (or via linked Notion docs/CMS fields). All content is version-controlled and auditable. They can easily schedule posts (blogs, social updates) by selecting a date/time and the platform (the system handles the rest via automation).
    
- **Automated Workflows:** A visual workflow builder or predefined automation templates (powered by n8n/Zapier under the hood) let users automate routine tasks. For example, when a blog post is marked “approved,” a workflow can automatically publish it to the website, share a snippet on Twitter and LinkedIn, and send a summary to the newsletter – all tagged for the correct brand. These workflows can be customized per brand or standardized across all.
    
- **Multi-Brand Analytics:** Real-time dashboards showing both aggregate metrics and per-brand performance. Users can view overall portfolio metrics (total web traffic, total leads across brands) as well as drill into, say, Partly Office’s web traffic trend. The system provides insights like comparisons (e.g., “Brand A’s engagement is 20% higher than Brand B this month”) and can highlight anomalies or opportunities (via AI-driven analysis).
    
- **AI Recommendations:** Beyond raw analytics, the system’s AI suggests data-driven actions. For instance, if one brand’s social posts perform better in the evening, the platform might recommend adjusting the posting schedule for other brands or alert the user to this pattern. It also can forecast trends (like expected traffic or engagement) to help in planning.
    
- **Integrated Social Media Planner:** A calendar interface where users can draft and schedule social media posts for each brand. They can see all scheduled posts color-coded by brand. The AI can auto-generate post text or images for each date, which users then tweak if needed. The planner ensures no overlap or conflicts in posting times and that each brand maintains an optimal cadence.
    
- **Email/Newsletter Campaigns:** Tools to design and send newsletters per brand, using providers like Resend or Mailchimp behind the scenes. Users can pick a template, have the AI draft the email content (summary of recent blog posts, for example), and schedule the send. Subscriber lists are managed per brand, but the interface to send emails is unified. The AI can also personalize content or subject lines based on past engagement data.
    
- **Chatbots & Support Agents:** Each brand can deploy a chatbot or AI assistant trained on its content and FAQs. Through a chat interface on the brand’s site or admin panel, the AI answers customer queries or helps gather information. These bots use a combination of OpenAI and the brand’s knowledge base (documents, prior Q&A). They are managed centrally (one could see and update each brand’s chatbot settings and training data in the admin).
    
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Fine-grained user roles ensure security and proper delegation. Admins can access all brands and system settings; Brand Managers can access everything within their brand hub; Content Creators can draft and publish content but not change core settings; Analysts might have read-only access to analytics. This prevents mistakes (e.g., someone inadvertently editing another brand’s content) and supports collaboration with external contributors safely (they can be limited to one brand or one content type).
    
- **Scalability & Multi-Tenancy:** The platform is built to easily support several brands in parallel without significant performance loss. Adding a new brand is streamlined – it should take only a few clicks or a short onboarding sequence (enter brand name, upload logo, choose template, and the system provisions the new brand space). All new brand data stays isolated while benefiting from the shared infrastructure (no need to set up a new server for each brand).
    

## Success Criteria

- **Fast Brand Onboarding:** Setting up a new brand (from creating the brand entry to having a functioning site or content space) takes less than 1 hour. This includes generating initial pages, populating default content templates, and configuring basic workflows. The ease of onboarding is crucial for scalability.
    
- **Autonomous Workflows:** At least 50% of routine content operations (like drafting social posts, compiling weekly reports, publishing scheduled content) are handled by the system’s AI and automation without manual intervention. Non-technical users should find that they rarely need a developer’s help to manage day-to-day tasks.
    
- **Real-Time Insights:** The analytics dashboard updates in near real-time (within seconds to a few minutes of events). When a piece of content is published or a campaign is sent, relevant metrics (views, clicks, conversions) start showing up immediately. This immediacy helps teams react faster.
    
- **Performance at Scale:** The platform supports 5+ distinct brands and their content (potentially hundreds of posts, workflows, and thousands of users) with no noticeable slowdowns in the UI or delays in automation. Server response times remain low (e.g., <200ms for API calls not involving heavy AI computation), and background AI tasks scale to handle peak loads (such as simultaneous content generation requests).
    
- **Brand Consistency:** All content produced by the AI or through the system passes brand guideline checks. This qualitative measure is assessed by brand managers: they should agree that the AI-generated outputs “sound like us.” Achieving a high approval rate of AI content (with minimal edits required) will indicate success in the multi-brand context training.
    
- **User Adoption & Satisfaction:** Internal teams (marketing, content, execs) transition to using this platform for all multi-brand tasks, reducing reliance on disparate tools (e.g., separate logins for each brand’s CMS, or manual copy-pasting between social schedulers). A successful outcome is when users report significant time saved and greater visibility across brands compared to their old workflow.
    

## Timeline

- **Phase 1: Core Platform & Two Brands (4 weeks)** – Set up the monorepo, database schema with RLS, and Next.js admin dashboard. Integrate two pilot brands (e.g., SaithavyS and Partly Office) including brand-specific pages and content templates. Implement basic content management (manual creation, editing) and analytics collection. Success criteria: Admin dashboard functioning for 2 brands, basic analytics visible, one example workflow (like a scheduled blog post) working.
    
- **Phase 2: AI Integration & Automation (3 weeks)** – Integrate AI services (OpenAI, etc.) and set up MCP servers for content generation and brand context. Implement the autonomous content draft feature and a couple of AI-driven workflows (e.g., auto-social posting). Launch the social media planner and email campaign features. Also introduce the third brand (G Prismo) to test multi-brand scaling. Success criteria: AI can generate content for each brand with distinct voices; workflows can automatically publish content; 3 brands are live in the system.
    
- **Phase 3: Advanced Features & Scaling (3 weeks)** – Add optional e-commerce integration and refine advanced analytics (cross-brand comparisons, AI recommendations on dashboard). Conduct load testing and optimize performance for supporting 5+ brands. Harden security (penetration testing for isolation between brands). Prepare documentation and onboarding guides. Success criteria: System remains stable under simulated high load, new brand addition is tested and takes ~1 hour, all major features documented for end users.
    

_(The timeline may be adjusted as needed, but the emphasis is on delivering core multi-brand functionality early, then layering on intelligence and extras.)_

## Deliverables

- **Complete Codebase (Monorepo):** A repository containing the Next.js admin app, any brand front-end code, MCP server code, and shared libraries. It should be organized, with scripts to run the whole system (for example, a docker-compose or npm workspaces script to spin up the database, servers, and front-end for local testing).
    
- **Three Configured Brand Hubs:** The platform set up with SaithavyS, Partly Office, and G Prismo as example brand instances. Each should have sample content, properly themed sections in the UI, and at least one unique workflow or content template to demonstrate specialization.
    
- **Central Dashboard Application:** Deployed version of the admin dashboard where all brand content and operations can be managed. This includes the brand switcher, content management interface, workflow automation UI, and analytics pages.
    
- **MCP AI Services:** The five core AI/microservices running (or containerized), with documentation on each. They should be ready to generate content, manage context, collect analytics, etc. Out-of-the-box, they will be configured for the three brands above but designed to accept new brand configurations.
    
- **Documentation & Onboarding Guide:** Clear documentation for both developers and end-users. For developers: architecture overview, how to deploy, how to add a new brand (steps to update config, run DB migrations for initial data, etc.), and how to extend features. For end-users: a guide on using the dashboard – managing content, triggering AI content creation, interpreting the analytics, and adjusting workflows. This may include quick-start pages in the admin UI itself or a PDF/Notion document.
    
- **Test Reports:** A summary of testing done (unit tests results, integration test coverage, load test outcomes) to give stakeholders confidence in the system’s reliability. Additionally, any compliance checklists (e.g., confirming that each brand’s data is only accessible by its users) should be delivered.
    

The successful completion of this project will provide the organization with a cutting-edge multi-brand management suite, where human creativity and decision-making are amplified by AI automation. It aims to drastically cut down the manual overhead of running multiple brands, freeing teams to focus on strategy and quality – while the platform handles execution and analysis at scale.
