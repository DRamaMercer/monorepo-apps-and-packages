**Date:** 2025-06-27 (Prior to this session)
**Summary:** The AI agent orchestration layer was successfully implemented, including the integration of Ollama and custom model execution capabilities. This involved setting up the core logic for agent management and interaction with various AI models.
**Relevant Files:** `mcp-servers/agent-orchestration/src/agents/agentManager.ts`, `mcp-servers/ollama-mcp/src/index.ts` (and related files for Ollama integration).
**Status:** Completed and verified.

## Task 1: Initialize Turborepo and Validate Directory Structure - Completed

**Date:** 2025-06-27 (Current session)
**Summary:** The monorepo has been successfully initialized with Turborepo. The base directory structure has been validated, shared configurations for TypeScript have been set up across all packages and applications, and all packages now build successfully. This involved extensive refactoring of `tsconfig.json` files, creating a new core runtime package for MCP services, and updating all MCP servers to conform to the new architecture.

**Details of Work Done:**
1.  **Turborepo Initialization**: Confirmed Turborepo was initialized and the current directory is the monorepo root.
2.  **`@modelcontextprotocol/runtime` Package Creation**: Created a new internal package `packages/runtime` to house core MCP interfaces and classes (`MCPService`, `MCPTool`, `MCPResource`, `ServerConfig`). This package now exports the foundational elements for building MCP servers.
3.  **`tsconfig.json` Refactoring**:
    *   Moved the base TypeScript configuration to `config/tsconfig.base.json`.
    *   Updated the root `tsconfig.json` to use project references, pointing to all `apps/*`, `packages/*`, and `mcp-servers/*`.
    *   Updated `tsconfig.json` files within each `apps`, `packages`, and `mcp-servers` directory to:
        *   Extend `../../config/tsconfig.base.json` (or `../../../config/tsconfig.base.json` for `mcp-servers`).
        *   Add `"composite": true` to all internal packages (`packages/*`).
        *   Add necessary `references` to `@modelcontextprotocol/runtime` and other internal packages.
        *   Set `outDir` and `rootDir` where appropriate.
        *   Explicitly set `"composite": false` and `"incremental": false` in `mcp-servers/agent-orchestration/tsconfig.json` to resolve `tsup` compatibility issues.
4.  **MCP Server Codebase Refactoring**:
    *   Rewrote `src/mcp/server.ts` for `agent-orchestration`, `analytics`, `asset-management`, `brand-context`, `content-generation`, and `workflow-orchestration` to:
        *   Extend the new `MCPService` abstract class from `@modelcontextprotocol/runtime`.
        *   Correctly instantiate `MCPTool` and `MCPResource` classes with their required `schema` properties (using `z.any()` or `z.object({})` as placeholders for complex schemas to resolve compilation errors).
        *   Pass `Hono` app and `ServerConfig` to the `super()` constructor.
    *   Rewrote `src/index.ts` for `agent-orchestration`, `analytics`, `asset-management`, `brand-context`, `content-generation`, and `workflow-orchestration` to:
        *   Import `createMCPServer` as a named export.
        *   Call `createMCPServer()` to get the `Hono` app instance, which encapsulates the MCP server logic.
        *   Remove redundant `Hono` app initialization and `serverConfig` objects.
        *   Ensure the `serve` function correctly uses the returned `Hono` app's `fetch` handler and `port`.
5.  **Dependency Management**:
    *   Added `hono`, `zod`, `winston`, `uuid`, and `@supabase/supabase-js` (and their `@types` counterparts) to the `dependencies` of the respective MCP server `package.json` files where they were missing.
    *   Removed extraneous `mcp` dependencies from `package.json` files.
    *   Removed `@types/winston` from all `package.json` files as `winston` provides its own types.
    *   Ran `npm install` multiple times to ensure all dependencies were correctly resolved and linked.

**Test Strategy Verification:**
1.  **Verify Turborepo installation and initialization**: Confirmed by the presence of `turbo.json` and successful execution of `turbo run build`.
2.  **Run `turbo run build` to ensure all packages can be built**: All 13 packages now build successfully.
3.  **Check if the directory structure matches the expected layout**: The monorepo structure is now aligned for shared configurations and inter-package dependencies.
4.  **Validate that shared configurations are properly recognized across the monorepo**: The successful compilation of all packages after `tsconfig.json` refactoring confirms this.

**Status:** Completed. All build errors resolved.

## Task 2: Scaffold MCP Server - Completed

**Date:** 2025-06-27 (Current session)
**Summary:** The initial structure for a generic MCP server using Hono.js has been successfully scaffolded. This involved creating the necessary directories, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsup.config.ts`, and a basic `src/index.ts` implementation that extends `MCPService` and registers example tools and resources. All monorepo-related dependency and build issues encountered during scaffolding were resolved.

**Details of Work Done:**
1.  **Directory Structure Creation**: Created `mcp-servers/generic-mcp/src/mcp` directory.
2.  **`package.json` Creation**: Created `mcp-servers/generic-mcp/package.json` with necessary `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `@modelcontextprotocol/runtime`, and `zod` dependencies, and `tsup` for building.
3.  **`tsconfig.json` Creation**: Created `mcp-servers/generic-mcp/tsconfig.json` extending `@repo/typescript-config/base.json`.
4.  **Root `tsconfig.json` Update**: Added project reference for `mcp-servers/generic-mcp` to the root `tsconfig.json`.
5.  **`tsup.config.ts` Creation**: Created `mcp-servers/generic-mcp/tsup.config.ts` for bundling.
6.  **`src/index.ts` Implementation**: Created a basic `src/index.ts` for `generic-mcp` that:
    *   Extends `MCPService`.
    *   Initializes with a `Hono` app instance and `ServerConfig`.
    *   Registers example `MCPTool` (`greet_user`) and `MCPResource` (`example_data`).
    *   Sets up a basic Hono server to listen on port 3000.
7.  **Dependency Resolution**:
    *   Resolved `npm install` `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` error by switching to `pnpm install`.
    *   Resolved `ERR_PNPM_FETCH_404` errors for `@monorepo/types` and `@monorepo/core` by updating `package.json` files in `mcp-servers/asset-management`, `brand-context`, `analytics`, `content-generation`, and `workflow-orchestration` to use `workspace:*` for internal dependencies and updating TypeScript versions for consistency.
    *   Resolved `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND` for `@repo/eslint-config` and `@repo/typescript-config` by updating `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to include `my-turborepo/packages/*`.
8.  **Build Verification**: Successfully built the `generic-mcp` package using `pnpm turbo run build --filter=generic-mcp --force`, confirming no compilation errors and proper linking.

**Test Strategy Verification:**
1.  **Successful `pnpm turbo run build --filter=generic-mcp`**: Confirmed the package builds without errors.
2.  **Successful `pnpm --filter=generic-mcp start`**: Confirmed the server starts and listens on port 3000.

**Status:** Completed.
