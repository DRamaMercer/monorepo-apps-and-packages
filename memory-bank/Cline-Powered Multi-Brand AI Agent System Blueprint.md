# Cline-Powered Multi-Brand AI Agent System Blueprint

## 1. Sequential Setup Checklist

1. **Initialize Monorepo & Turborepo**: Begin by creating a new mono-repository and initializing Turborepo. Set up a root `package.json` with workspaces for `apps/*` and `packages/*`, and add Turborepo as a dev dependency. Include common scripts to run development, builds, tests, and to start all MCP servers via Turborepo. This provides a unified workspace for frontend, backend, and agent services.
    
2. **Create Base Workspace Structure**: Establish the directory skeleton for the project. At minimum, create folders for `mcp-servers/`, `cline_docs/`, `project-ai/` (application code), `local-ai/` (local AI stack), and `monitoring/`. Within `cline_docs`, create an empty **.cline-rules** file to hold development rules (populated in a later step) and stub documentation files as placeholders (e.g. `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, etc. for project vision and architecture). These placeholders will be later populated by AI agents with documentation.
    
3. **Configure Cline & MCP Integration**: In the project root, add a **.cline/** directory containing configuration files for Cline 3.0+. Include an `mcp-servers.json` defining available MCP servers, a `brand-contexts.json` with each brand’s context settings, and a `pipeline-rules.yaml` that outlines the agent pipeline. Ensure the pipeline rules file enables MCP integration and multi-brand support (e.g. `mcp_integration: true` and `multi_brand_support: true`). These configs orchestrate how the autonomous agent coordinates tasks.
    
4. **Set Up Full-Stack Frameworks**: Align the codebase for full-stack development across frontend, backend, workflows, and analytics. Create a Next.js 14 application (e.g. under `apps/web` or `/dash`) for the multi-brand dashboard UI. Create a Hono.js server (e.g. under `apps/api`) for high-performance backend APIs. Configure Supabase (or a PostgreSQL DB) for brand-segmented data storage and analytics. These choices are codified in the project’s guidelines (e.g. using Next.js 14 with the App Router for the frontend and Hono.js for APIs). At this stage, set up environment variables and connections for Supabase (such as URL and service key) and initialize any required schemas or tables for multi-brand data (e.g. brand tables, content tables as placeholders).
    
5. **Integrate Local AI Stack**: Install and configure local AI model serving to enable autonomous code generation. For example, install **Ollama** (a local LLM runner) and pull essential code-generation models (like `deepseek-coder-v2` and Code Llama). Set up a vector database (e.g. Weaviate) to serve as a memory index for the AI. This ensures the coding agent can use local models for privacy and speed, and store embeddings for long-term memory. Verify the local AI services (Ollama and vector DB) are running before proceeding.
    
6. **Scaffold Core MCP Servers**: Use the MCP SDK to scaffold the key servers that will power the AI agent’s reasoning. Priority should be given to a **Workspace Context MCP** (for project structure awareness) and a **Code Generation MCP** (for autonomous coding). For example, create a `workspace-context-server` project under `mcp-servers/` using the MCP SDK’s generator (e.g. `npx create-mcp-server workspace-context`). Repeat for other core servers like `code-gen-mcp`, `docs-mcp`, etc., creating placeholders for their implementation. After generation, update each MCP server’s configuration (name, version, supported capabilities) to reflect multi-brand needs. Each MCP will later be implemented in detail, but initializing them now integrates them into the pipeline.
    
7. **Populate Cline Rules & Guidelines**: Define the project’s autonomous development rules in the **cline_docs/.cline-rules** file. This includes high-level development principles (e.g. multi-brand architecture compliance, comprehensive documentation, type safety) and coding patterns for each layer (database, API, frontend) aligned with the chosen stack. For instance, specify using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL and brand-level RLS for the database, Hono.js with OpenAPI for APIs, and Next.js 14 with accessibility and SEO best practices for the frontend. Also include an MCP integration section stating that all major features require an MCP tool and that brand context must be included in every operation. These rules will guide the AI agents during code generation and ensure consistency.
    
8. **Full-Stack Component Setup**: Initialize the frontend and backend projects within the monorepo. For the Next.js app, set up a basic multi-brand dashboard page and a brand selector (even if just a placeholder UI) to verify the Next.js 14 App Router is configured. For the Hono backend, create a simple API route (like a health check or a test endpoint) to confirm the server runs. Connect the backend to Supabase by configuring a client or REST calls – for example, ensure a Supabase service role key is available to the Hono app for database access. These initial components serve as a scaffolding that the AI agents can later expand (the AI will generate actual features and endpoints in subsequent phases).
    
9. **Analytics & Workflow Stubs**: Set up scaffolding for workflows (automation) and analytics. For workflows, include an automation tool like **n8n** or Make.com – this could be a container or cloud service, but in the project, you might include a client or at least documentation on connecting triggers. For analytics, prepare a structure for collecting metrics (e.g. a Supabase schema for performance metrics per brand). At minimum, create documentation placeholders such as `supabase-schema.md` and `brand-kpis.md` in `cline_docs/implementation/` or `cline_docs/metrics/` to outline how analytics will be handled. This ensures that as the AI builds out analytics features, it follows a pre-defined plan.
    

Each step above sets up the foundation for an autonomous, full-stack development workflow. By the end of this checklist, the project should have a mono-repo initialized with Turborepo, key config files in place, placeholder docs and code structures, and running services for local AI and databases – all ready for the AI agents (powered by Cline 3.0’s MCP) to start coding within a controlled framework.

## 2. Project Directory and File Structure

```

**Monorepo Structure with Turborepo:** The root is configured as a Turborepo, meaning the `apps/` and `packages/` directories are recognized as part of the workspace. This allows separate build/test scripts for the Next.js app, Hono API, and any other app (like `workflows` for automation), while sharing code via `packages/`. For example, the database models and brand logic can live in a shared `db/` or `core/` package and be imported by both the frontend and backend.

**Cline Documentation (Memory Bank):** The `cline_docs/` directory acts as the **memory bank** for the AI agents, storing all persistent knowledge and rules. It contains global documentation (project vision, architecture patterns, tech context) and a `brands/` subfolder with **brand-specific docs** for each brand’s voice, style, and strategy. Each brand folder (e.g. `saithavys/`) can hold documents like content strategy, training data specifics, and performance targets for that brand. These files serve as long-term memory: when the AI agent works on SaithavyS tasks, it will consult `cline_docs/brands/saithavys/*` for context, ensuring the output aligns with that brand's identity. The **.cline-rules** file in `cline_docs` codifies the overall coding rules the agent must follow (from naming conventions to technology choices), while **pipeline-rules.yaml** in `.cline/` defines the procedural pipeline the agent orchestrator will execute.

**MCP Servers Directory:** All Model Context Protocol servers are contained in `mcp-servers/` for modularity. Each MCP server corresponds to a specific cognitive domain or pipeline stage:

- _Workspace/Brand Context Server_: Handles brand detection, context switching, and ensures any action is taken with the correct brand context.
    
- _Content/Code Generation Server_: Responsible for generating code or content in the appropriate “voice” or style for the brand.
    
- _Analytics Server_: Gathers results, metrics and provides performance feedback loops (e.g. which content performs better).
    
- _Asset Management Server_: Deals with files, templates, and other assets, organized per brand.
    
- _Workflow Orchestration Server_: Manages the sequence of tasks, triggers cross-brand workflows, and ensures that multi-step processes happen in order (i.e. “sequential thinking”).
    
- _(Optional) Documentation Server_: A potential MCP server to automate documentation (from code comments to user guides), ensuring the codebase remains self-documented.
    

Each server is implemented as an isolated service (e.g. Node processes possibly communicating via stdio or HTTP). This separation aligns with the Cline 3.0 architecture where specialized MCP servers handle different aspects of the development pipeline in parallel, yet remain coordinated through the central pipeline rules.

**Prompt Templates:** The `prompts/` directory contains YAML or text prompt templates defining how each agent role should behave. There are universal prompts for generic behaviors and brand-specific prompts for each brand’s agents. For example, a prompt template for “SaithavyS Personal Brand Architect” might include the tone and style guidelines that the content generation agent should follow for SaithavyS content. Organizing prompts by brand ensures the AI’s outputs remain differentiated (e.g. more professional tone for Partly Office vs. innovative tone for G Prismo) without mixing contexts.

Overall, this structure is optimized for a multi-brand scenario: shared code and configs live at the root or in packages, while anything brand-specific is neatly partitioned under `brands/` in docs, prompts, and possibly in config files or data. Turborepo’s tooling allows you to run and build all these parts efficiently in one repo, which is essential as the autonomous agent will be generating and modifying files across the entire stack.

## 3. Rule & Documentation Integration

A robust rules and documentation system is critical for guiding an autonomous coding agent. In this blueprint, we integrate **Cline rules**, pipeline definitions, and auto-documentation in a cohesive way:

- **.cline-rules (Autonomous Development Rules):** The file `cline_docs/.cline-rules` contains curated rules that the AI must always follow during development. These include:
    
    - _Development Principles:_ High-level guidelines such as “maintain zero licensing costs (use open source only)” and “follow security-first practices”. These principles ensure that from the outset, all AI-generated code respects licensing and security constraints.
        
    - _Code Patterns:_ Preferred patterns for each layer of the stack. For example, under `api:` it might specify using Hono.js with proper CORS and error handling, and under `frontend:` it mandates Next.js 14 with SEO and accessibility compliance. These act as coding standards so that any code the agent writes aligns with best practices (e.g. if the agent is writing an API endpoint, it should naturally use the Hono framework and include CORS headers as per the rules).
        
    - _MCP Integration:_ Rules ensuring the agent leverages the MCP servers properly. For instance, one rule states that every major feature must involve an MCP server (no significant logic is written without an AI “tool”), and that all MCP calls must include the current brand context. This guarantees the multi-agent pipeline is used to its full extent and remains brand-aware in every operation.
        
    - _Testing Strategy:_ Guidelines for automatic test creation and performance checks (e.g. “Unit tests with Vitest” and “E2E tests with Playwright” for anything the agent builds). The agent will refer to these to generate tests alongside features.
        
    
    These rules are loaded into Cline’s memory so that during plan formation and code generation, the agent can reference them. The structure is typically YAML or an INI-like format with sections, which Cline 3.0 can parse and enforce. By externalizing such rules, we can update them without changing the agent’s code, and the agent will adapt its behavior accordingly.
    
- **MCP Pipeline YAML:** The `.cline/pipeline-rules.yaml` file encodes the sequence of steps (stages) the orchestrator agent and MCP servers will execute for various tasks. It defines triggers, dependencies, and assignments of tasks to MCPs. For example:
    
    - A **brand context detection** stage (triggered whenever new content input is received or a user selects a brand) is handled by the `brand_context_server` MCP. This stage sets the context for all subsequent steps.
        
    - A **content generation** stage that depends on context detection is handled by the `content_generation_server` MCP, ensuring that generation (code or content) happens with the brand’s voice and style.
        
    - A **validation** stage where the `brand_context_server` validates the generated output against brand guidelines (making sure, for instance, a SaithavyS article doesn’t inadvertently use a corporate tone).
        
    - Additional stages for organizing assets, tracking analytics, and triggering cross-brand optimizations are included as well. Each stage has either a trigger (event-based or scheduled) or dependencies ensuring a proper sequence.
        
    
    This pipeline YAML essentially codifies the “playbook” for the orchestrator: what to do first, what next, which MCP handles it, and how stages interrelate. The blueprint sets this up with placeholders for each major phase of the content creation pipeline, which can be refined as the project evolves. Keeping these definitions in a YAML allows easy adjustments to the workflow (the team can tweak the sequence or add new stages without rewriting agent code).
    
- **Memory Bank Documentation:** For real-time documentation and knowledge integration, the memory bank (inside `cline_docs/`) is structured to be both human-readable and machine-consumable. The brand-specific files (e.g. brand guidelines, content strategy docs) provide reference material that the agent uses when generating content or code for that brand. To keep these up-to-date:
    
    - Implement an **auto-documentation update** mechanism: whenever the AI agent creates or changes a feature, it should also update relevant documentation files. For example, if a new API endpoint is generated, the agent should add an entry to an API documentation markdown, or if a new component is created, update the architecture or progress docs. This can be achieved via a tool in the Workspace Context MCP server – indeed, the agent’s toolset includes an `update_documentation` action that takes a component name and description of changes to update the docs accordingly. By invoking this after code generation tasks, the documentation stays current without manual intervention.
        
    - Encourage “co-documentation” – i.e., writing code and documentation in parallel. The pipeline can include a step for documentation (possibly handled by a documentation MCP or the orchestrator itself) so that for every major feature or change, a corresponding doc update is enforced. For example, the **Documentation MCP** (if configured) could generate API docs from code or update a changelog automatically. In absence of a dedicated server, the orchestrator can simply use templated markdown updates as part of the workflow.
        
- **Consistency via Brand Standards:** To ensure consistency across all memory bank files and outputs, we leverage brand context standards at multiple levels:
    
    - Each brand folder in `cline_docs/brands/` contains that brand’s **voice and style guidelines** (e.g., lists of preferred tone, style, and “anti-values” to avoid). The AI references these when writing content. Additionally, the `brand-guidelines.md` (if present globally or per brand) describes the overall persona and do’s/don’ts for that brand. The presence of this documentation means the agent can be directed to adhere to it at generation time.
        
    - The **Brand Context MCP server** actively enforces guideline compliance. It has capabilities like `brand_validation` and `guideline_enforcement` built-in. In practice, after the content or code is generated, it passes through this server which checks the output against the known brand rules (for example, scanning for forbidden phrases or ensuring the tone matches). If something is off, the pipeline can flag it or adjust the output. This automated validation loop keeps all artifacts aligned with their brand standards.
        
    - The **Brand Context Manager role** (one of the AI agent roles) is tasked with ensuring brand consistency and guideline enforcement across the board. This role’s memory includes the brand standards and it works in tandem with the orchestrator to correct any deviations.
        
- **Real-Time Documentation and Knowledge Sync:** The system should allow for continuous learning – for example, if new FAQs or user feedback come in for a specific brand, adding them to the brand’s docs (memory) will immediately influence the agent’s future outputs for that brand. We plan for a feedback mechanism where the agent can update its own knowledge base. This could be triggered by the **analytics server** identifying a content gap or poor performance in one area, then prompting an update to the docs or prompts. By structuring `cline_docs` clearly and using automated tools to maintain them, the knowledge remains synchronized with development.
    

In summary, the rules (.cline-rules) provide the **guardrails** for development, the pipeline YAML provides the **roadmap** of execution, and the memory bank docs serve as the **knowledge source**. The blueprint ensures that changes in one (e.g., updating a rule or a guideline) propagate through the system – the autonomous agent will adjust its plans based on new rules, and the validation stages will enforce them, resulting in a highly consistent and well-documented codebase.

## 4. AI Agent Orchestration Setup

To manage the complexity of multi-brand development, the architecture employs an **Orchestrator Agent** alongside specialized sub-agents, all coordinated via the MCP servers:

- **Orchestrator Agent Role**: The orchestrator acts as the **front-end chatbot** interface and master coordinator. In a live system, this is the agent that the developer (or user) interacts with directly, for example through a chat UI in the Next.js dashboard. Its job is to take high-level instructions (e.g. “Implement a blog feature for Partly Office brand”) and break them down into tasks for other agents to execute. According to our role design, the orchestrator (often called the “Multi-Brand Orchestrator” role) has access to core servers like the brand context server and workflow server, and is responsible for portfolio-level strategy and cross-brand coordination. This means it can handle commands spanning multiple brands or decide how to allocate resources between brand-specific agents.
    
- **Coordination Protocols**: The orchestrator uses the defined pipeline rules to know which MCP servers to invoke in what order. For example, on receiving a request, it will:
    
    1. Call the **Brand Context MCP** to detect or confirm which brand the task is for, and lock in that context.
        
    2. Pass the task to the **Content/Code Generation MCP** for actual execution (writing code, creating content) with the brand context attached.
        
    3. Once generation is done, route the output to the **Brand Context MCP** again for validation (ensuring it aligns with brand guidelines).
        
    4. If the task involves saving files or templates, use the **Asset Management MCP** to place outputs in the correct brand-specific location or format.
        
    5. Finally, notify the **Analytics MCP** to record metrics about this operation (e.g. content quality score, time taken, etc.), and trigger any **Workflow MCP** actions (like scheduling follow-ups or cross-posting content).
        
    
    These steps happen in a loop orchestrated by the agent. The “protocol” here is essentially the orchestrator following the pipeline script and using inter-agent communication. All agents speak via the Model Context Protocol, meaning the orchestrator sends structured requests to each MCP server and they return results or completions which the orchestrator then uses to decide the next step. This design ensures even complex, multi-step tasks are handled methodically by the AI, mimicking a project manager delegating to a team of specialists.
    
- **Role-Specific Memory & Patterns**: Each specialized agent (which can be thought of as roles or personas) maintains its own context and memory patterns. For instance:
    
    - A **Content Generation Agent** tuned for SaithavyS will load SaithavyS-specific documents and style from `cline_docs/brands/saithavys/` and use prompt patterns suited to an “authentic, inspiring” tone.
        
    - Another agent, say the **Compliance/Validation Agent** for Partly Office, will focus on professional standards and ensuring output meets Partly Office’s stricter tone and formatting rules.
        
    - There are also cross-brand agents like a **Cross-Brand Analyst** who looks at data across all brands to find common insights or opportunities.
        
    
    The orchestrator’s job is to activate the right agent for each job. It might do so by directly invoking an MCP tool, or by internally switching “mode” to a different role prompt. Because each agent role has its memory segmented (they primarily refer to their own docs and rules relevant to their function), this prevents knowledge contamination between brands. It implements a form of **brand-aware routing**: the orchestrator ensures that tasks meant for one brand do not accidentally incorporate another brand’s data or style. This is supported by the system’s design (the Brand Context server will flag if an agent tries to use the wrong brand’s context) and by the workflow orchestration logic that includes brand routing as a feature.
    
- **Brand-Aware Routing and Switching**: When a user or a high-level job specifies a brand, the orchestrator tags that context globally. Our MCP integration defines a **Brand Detection Engine** inside the Brand Context MCP, which can auto-detect brand intent from a prompt if not explicitly given. Once detected, a **Context Switcher** component ensures all subsequent agent actions are “locked” to that brand until the task is complete. The orchestrator uses this to guarantee, for example, that a Partly Office feature development will consistently use the Partly Office tone, database schema, and assets. If a new task for a different brand comes in, the orchestrator invokes the context switcher to load the new brand’s settings and memories. This design allows seamless multi-brand operation within one running agent system: effectively, the AI can pivot its entire knowledge and style between SaithavyS, Partly Office, or G Prismo on demand, under orchestrator control.
    
- **Workflow and Multi-Agent Coordination**: The Workflow Orchestration MCP plays a key part in sequential and parallel task management. The orchestrator agent, through this server, can kick off automated workflows such as:
    
    - Publishing content after it’s approved (e.g. scheduling a post via Zapier or calling a CMS API),
        
    - Notifying stakeholders (maybe using an integration to Slack or email when a task is done),
        
    - Triggering follow-up tasks across brands (for instance, after a G Prismo tech article is published, maybe prompt the SaithavyS agent to create a summary for a general audience, coordinating cross-brand content).
        
    
    Essentially, the orchestrator coordinates not just within the single-machine context of code generation, but also external actions and multi-step flows. The **orchestrator agent** can be seen as the conductor, and the MCP servers as the sections of the orchestra – each performing its part when cued. This ensures the autonomous system doesn’t just write code or content, but also handles the surrounding tasks (like documentation, deployment steps, notifications) in a unified manner.
    

In practical terms, setting this up involves writing prompt personas for each role, ensuring the orchestrator’s prompt or logic is aware of all other agents' capabilities, and configuring the `.cline/mcp-servers.json` with entries for each MCP server (with addresses/ports if they run as separate processes). Once running, a developer could ask the orchestrator (via the VS Code interface or the Next.js chat UI) to perform a high-level task, and behind the scenes the orchestrator will coordinate all necessary agents to fulfill the request, end-to-end.

## 5. Toolchain and VS Code Integration

To maximize productivity and transparency while using the autonomous agent system, a well-chosen developer toolchain is essential. Here are recommended tools and VS Code extensions for this environment:

- **Cline VS Code Extension (AI Agent Integration)**: Install the Cline extension in VS Code to embed the autonomous coding agent directly into the IDE. This extension provides an interface for the Plan/Act cycle of the agent, allowing you to issue commands and review the AI’s reasoning as it develops code. With Cline in VS Code, you essentially get a chat-driven coding assistant that can edit files, run commands, and interface with the MCP servers. Make sure to configure the extension with your local API keys or model endpoints (for instance, pointing it to use your local Ollama models or OpenAI keys if needed). The extension will significantly streamline interacting with the agent, letting you trigger the orchestrator or specialized agents without leaving VS Code.
    
- **YAML and JSON Support**: Since a lot of configuration (rules, pipeline, prompts) is in YAML/JSON, use a YAML language extension for VS Code. The **YAML Language Support by Red Hat** is a great choice, offering schema validation and error highlighting. This helps prevent formatting mistakes in files like `pipeline-rules.yaml` or `supabase config` files. Similarly, ensure you have JSON support (VS Code has built-in JSON validation) for editing `.json` config files like `mcp-servers.json`. These extensions will alert you to any syntax issues before the agent tries to parse these files, saving debugging time.
    
- **Markdown Editing and Preview**: The memory bank and documentation are Markdown-based, so enhancing VS Code for Markdown is beneficial. The **Markdown All in One** extension provides conveniences like automatic table of contents generation and keyboard shortcuts for formatting. More importantly for our use-case, enable Markdown preview plugins that support **Mermaid diagrams**. We include architecture and workflow diagrams (Mermaid code blocks) in our docs (for example, illustrating MCP interactions) – using an extension like **Markdown Preview Mermaid Support** allows you to render and view these diagrams directly in VS Code. This is extremely useful to visualize pipelines or architecture while editing the docs. Overall, a good Markdown setup ensures that as the AI updates documentation, you can easily review the output in a readable format and make quick manual edits if needed.
    
- **Version Control and MCP Pipeline Visibility**: While not a traditional “extension”, it’s recommended to leverage source control (git) integration in VS Code to track the agent’s changes. The agent will be creating and modifying files; using GitLens or the built-in Git support helps you see diffs and history. For pipeline visibility specifically, consider maintaining a Mermaid diagram of the pipeline (as in the documentation) and using the preview as mentioned above. If you prefer a more interactive view, you could use tools like **Graphviz** outside VS Code or find a graph visualization extension, but Mermaid in Markdown should suffice to convey pipeline flows. Additionally, keep the **Cline output panel** open (provided by the extension) – this shows the agent’s step-by-step plan and actions, effectively letting you “debug” the pipeline as it runs (you'll see which MCP servers are called and with what outcome at each step).
    
- **Debugging Tools for Agents**: Debugging an autonomous agent can mean debugging the code it writes and the decisions it makes. Two angles:
    
    1. _Debugging Generated Code_: Use standard debugging extensions for the tech stack. For example, install the VS Code **JavaScript/TypeScript Debugger** (built-in) for running the Next.js app or the Hono server. You can set breakpoints and step through the AI-generated code just like any hand-written code. This is crucial when the agent produces complex logic – you want to verify it works as intended. For frontend, the built-in Chrome/Edge dev tools integration in VS Code can help debug UI issues in the Next.js app.
        
    2. _Debugging Agent Logic_: The agent’s logic lives in the MCP servers and the plan it forms. You can run MCP server code in debug mode too. For example, open the `workspace-context-server` project in VS Code and use a Node.js debug configuration to step through its code (the MCP SDK server provides hooks you might step into, and you can certainly debug your custom handlers like `analyzeProjectStructure` or `updateDocumentation`). Ensure all MCP servers are instrumented with good logging. The importance of logging cannot be overstated – having each server log its inputs, outputs, and any errors will help trace through multi-step processes. For instance, if the orchestrator stalls, logs from the Workflow MCP might reveal it was waiting on a trigger. Use extensions like **Log File Highlighter** if needed to color-code log outputs in VS Code for easier reading.
        
- **Additional Helpful Extensions**:
    
    - _ESLint/Prettier_: To maintain code quality and consistency in formatting for all the code the AI generates. An ESLint extension will highlight any syntax or style violations in real-time.
        
    - _Tailwind CSS IntelliSense_: Since Next.js is using Tailwind CSS (as per our guidelines), this extension autocompletes and checks classes.
        
    - _REST Client or Thunder Client_: These help test API endpoints quickly from VS Code. After the agent creates new Hono API routes, you can write a sample request in a `.http` file and use the REST Client extension to execute it, verifying the response.
        
    - _Todo Tree or Project Manager_: As the AI generates TODO comments or you maintain a list of tasks, these can help keep track.
        
    - _Mermaid Preview_ (as mentioned): to visualize architecture diagrams which is very useful for understanding complex orchestrations at a glance.
        

By setting up your editor with the above, you create a developer-friendly cockpit for the autonomous system. You’ll be able to monitor and intervene if necessary as the AI works. For example, you might watch the agent’s plan in the Cline panel, see it creating files in the explorer, use Git lens to review changes, and quickly preview the updated documentation – all within VS Code. This tight integration empowers a single developer to supervise a lot of automated work effectively.

## 6. Rule Application Timeline

Implementing this multi-brand AI agent system is an iterative process. We propose a phased timeline to introduce and enforce rules and development logic across the project’s life cycle, aligning with major development phases:

- **Phase 1: Setup (Foundation)** – _Focus on Workspace Rules._ In the initial week of the project, concentrate on laying down the foundation and global constraints. This includes establishing the directory structure and config files (the agent’s “workspace rules” are basically the expected project anatomy). At this stage, enforce rules like the multi-brand folder setup, security basics, and open-source only policy. For example, before any coding starts, the `.cline-rules` should state the licensing rule and security principle, and the project should have the Supabase and environment configuration in place with proper access control. Essentially, the agent should not be allowed to code anything until the workspace looks correct – the **Workspace Context MCP** can even analyze the project structure and flag missing pieces (via the `analyze_project_structure` tool) to ensure setup completeness. The outcome of Phase 1 is a “ready-to-build” environment: all baseline rules loaded, all essential directories/files present, and basic services running.
    
- **Phase 2: Scaffolding (Project Skeleton)** – _Apply Global Architecture Patterns._ Once the foundation is in place, the next step (perhaps during the second week) is scaffolding the project’s skeleton by the AI. This means generating boilerplate code for the Next.js app, Hono API, and creating placeholder modules (the agent can create dummy pages, API endpoints, database schema migrations, etc.). During scaffolding, global rules and patterns from `.cline-rules` guide the structure of this code. For instance, as the agent generates the initial Next.js pages, it should automatically include SEO meta tags and accessibility checks because our rules mandated those for frontend. If it sets up the database schema, it should include brand identifiers in tables and RLS policies as per the multi-brand data pattern. At this stage, we also enforce that every scaffolded feature is paired with documentation stubs and basic tests – the agent should create e.g. a `README` section or update `progress.md` to note what was scaffolded. The orchestrator and pipeline come into play here by sequencing tasks (generate code, then update docs, then maybe run a format/lint check). By end of Phase 2, we have a compilable, runnable application with no real features but with the correct architecture and lots of placeholders (all of which adhere to the overall architecture conventions).
    
- **Phase 3: Implementation (Feature Development)** – _Enforce Development Logic & Brand Rules._ This phase spans the bulk of development time, where actual features for each brand are implemented autonomously by the agent. As each new feature or user story is tackled, the system applies:
    
    - **Workspace/Global Rules**: The agent continues to obey the global design patterns (never deviating into disallowed frameworks or bad practices). For example, if at this point one brand needs a blog feature, the agent will use the agreed stack (Next.js for the UI, Hono for any API, Supabase for storage) – deviating would conflict with rules and likely be caught by the MCP validators.
        
    - **Brand-Specific Rules**: For any brand-specific feature, the brand’s guidelines are actively enforced by the brand context validation stage. If the agent tries to produce content that doesn’t match the brand voice, the Brand Context MCP will flag it and the agent will have to correct it, potentially by adjusting its prompts or using the brand’s style examples from memory. This ensures, over time, every piece of content or code has the signature of its brand.
        
    - **Sequential Logic & Workflow**: As features grow, some tasks will involve orchestrating multiple steps (e.g. generate code -> get review -> deploy). The orchestrator agent uses the workflow rules to enforce logic sequence. For example, a rule might say testing must follow generation, or documentation must be updated after code changes. So in Phase 3, after each feature code generation, the orchestrator automatically invokes the test generation agent and documentation update tool, rather than leaving these as optional. This ingrains a culture of comprehensive development – code, test, and docs all move together.
        
    
    Phase 3 is iterative and may be broken into mini-cycles (design, code, test for feature A, then feature B, etc.). By the end of it, you should have a functional system for all brands, with each component built under strict adherence to rules and thoroughly documented.
    
- **Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance** – _Global QA and Rule Audits._ While testing is partly integrated in Phase 3, Phase 4 (which can overlap or be a distinct hardening phase) emphasizes validating that all rules have been followed and that the system is robust. Utilize the **Testing MCP** (if available) or just run all automated tests the agent produced. At this stage, run a **brand consistency audit** across the content and codebase – for example, use the brand context manager to scan content of each brand for consistency issues (our pipeline includes a QA rule for brand consistency per content piece). Also perform a cross-brand review to ensure no brand’s content is leaking into another’s (for instance, check that G Prismo code or copy doesn’t appear in SaithavyS sections). The analytics server can help here by producing a report of how each brand’s outputs differ or adhere to their profiles. If any violations or bugs are found, feed those back into the development loop (the agent can fix them). Essentially, Phase 4 is about verifying the agent’s work against the original blueprint rules one more time and addressing any gaps.
    
    Additionally, during this phase, test the failure modes and recovery: deliberately introduce a small change in rules or a new rule and see if the agent adapts (for example, add a rule that all API responses must include a certain header, then see if the agent updates the Hono routes accordingly). This ensures the system remains malleable and truly driven by the rule set.
    
- **Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance** – _Apply Deployment Rules & Global Policies._ In the final phase (pre-launch and beyond), focus on the rules related to deployment, security, and ongoing operations. The **Deployment MCP** (if part of the system) would now take center stage to generate infrastructure-as-code (Terraform files, Docker setups as per our structure) and deployment pipelines. The agent should follow any global rules about CI/CD (for example, maybe a rule that all secrets must come from environment variables and not be hard-coded – this would be enforced now). Implement any remaining global rules that weren’t relevant during dev, such as disaster recovery plans or backup procedures, which might have been outlined in documentation. Phase 5 is also where you ensure **global governance rules** are met – e.g. all third-party libraries should be open-source (audit `package.json` against the rule), all data storage follows compliance (as per any security rules laid out).
    
    After deployment, the system enters a maintenance loop. The rules and memory architecture we set up will continue to guide the agent as it possibly handles live content updates or further enhancements. The orchestrator can schedule periodic reviews (as seen in our pipeline, e.g. a weekly cross-brand optimization review) to keep improving the system. Thus, even in maintenance, the timeline circles back: the agent might identify a new improvement, which triggers a mini Phase-3-like implementation cycle under the same rule constraints, followed by testing, and deployment.
    

Throughout these phases, it’s important to remember the advice: _“Document as you build” and “Test incrementally”_. Our blueprint inherently encourages this by making the AI update docs and write tests in every phase, not at the end. Similarly, _“Start with security”_ – we apply that in Phase 1 by including RLS and API key management early on. By following the phased approach, the multi-brand AI agent system is gradually built with confidence: each phase cements a layer of rules (from basic structure to complex behavior), ensuring that when the system is fully operational, it consistently produces high-quality, brand-specific outputs in a reliable manner.
