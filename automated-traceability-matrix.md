# Automated Traceability Matrix Generation System

This document outlines the design and implementation of the Automated Traceability Matrix Generation system for the Cline-Powered Multi-Brand AI Agent System.

## 1. Overview

The Automated Traceability Matrix Generation system is designed to automatically create, maintain, and validate traceability relationships between requirements, design elements, implementation artifacts, and test cases across the entire system. This ensures comprehensive coverage of all requirements and facilitates impact analysis, compliance verification, and project management.

## 4. Matrix Types

The system supports generation of several matrix types:

1. **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**
   - Maps requirements to their implementations
   - Shows test coverage for each requirement
   - Identifies documentation coverage

2. **Coverage Matrix**
   - Displays test coverage percentage for requirements
   - Shows implementation coverage of requirements
   - Presents documentation coverage metrics

3. **Impact Analysis Matrix**
